## Skills

#### Communication

Being able to effectively communicate with the clients and other stakeholders, means I can achieve much more during the shorter amount of time thanks to trust I gained while developing the relationships.

- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence

#### Organisation

Having worked as a project manager for three years, organisation and time management were the essential skills I developed to the top level over that period.

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

#### Methodical

* Precision and attention to detail is the skill I have developed during my linguistic career, and honed to perfection during three months at Makers Academy where it proved a highly valuable skill, since following a procedure while solving coding problems or debugging makes it a less frustrating task.
