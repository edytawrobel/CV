## Skills

#### Methodical

* Precision and attention to detail is the skill I have developed during my linguistic career, and honed to perfection during three months at Makers Academy where it proved a highly valuable skill, since following a procedure while solving coding problems or debugging makes it a less frustrating task.

#### Communication

Being able to effectively communicate with the clients and other stakeholders, means I can achieve much more during the shorter amount of time thanks to trust I gained while developing the relationships.

- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence

#### Organisation and focus

Having worked as a project manager for three years, organisation and time management were the essential skills I developed to the top level over that period. 

- Advanced in the role only within a year
- Maintain good client/supplier relationships through meetings, phone catch-ups and email 
- Maintain the company database and other data (Translation Memories, instructions, etc.)
- Optimal use of the translation technologies to maximize the profit margins
